  val: `To understand how to improve your business, you should start by looking at the overall trend in the data. From the data set, you can see that the highest profit margin is coming from Office Supplies (43%). Technology is also producing a profit margin of 13%, but it is not as high as Office Supplies. When looking at each category and sub-category, you can see that the highest profit margins are coming from Office Supplies, such as Labels (44%), Envelopes (42%), and Fasteners (31%). These sub-categories should be targeted for growth in order to increase profits.
  In terms of Furniture, the profit margins are lower than Office Supplies. You can see that Tables and Bookcases are producing negative margins (-8.56% and -3.02%), so focusing on these sub-categories may help improve the overall profits of Furniture. In terms of Technology, the profit margin is 13%.  
  This is a good profit margin, but there is still potential for growth. You can target the sub-categories of Accessories (25%), Machines (2%), and Copiers (37%) for potential growth. Overall, you can see that Office Supplies is producing the highest profit margins and Furniture is producing the lowest profit margins. You can take these insights and use them to focus your growth strategies in order to improve your business.

let shippingRes = {
  key: "performance by shipping modes",  
 val:`From this dataset, we can see that there are three distinct customer segments: Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office.Within each of these segments, there are four different ship modes—Standard Class, Second Class, Same Day, and First Class.There are two measurements—sales and profits. Using this data, we can determine which shipping mode is the most profitable and which customers are the most profitable.

 By looking at the sales figures, we can see that Standard Class is the most popular shipping mode for all customer segments.This could be an area to focus on for potential optimization. We can also look at the profits for each shipping mode and customer segment.From this, we can see that Profit is greatest in the First Class shipping mode for all customer segments.
 
 This suggests that offering a First Class shipping option may be the most profitable.Looking further, it is also evident that Corporate customers produce the highest profits overall.This suggests that focusing marketing or sales efforts on Corporate customers may be most beneficial for profits. Overall, this data set can be used to help understand which customer segments are the most profitable and which shipping modes are the most profitable.
 
 From this analysis, we can then make informed decisions on how to optimize the business to improve sales and profits`

  val: "To begin, it would be helpful to look at the different metrics within the data set to get an understanding of what is going on with each of the manufacturers. It is important to note that there are two major metrics: AGG (profit margin) and AVG (discount). This is the most important information when attempting to improve the business. When looking at AGG, it is clear that the higher the profit margin, the better the business is doing. The manufacturers with the highest AGG are Tyvek (44.043), Strathmore (47.245), and REDIFORM (45.117). These manufacturers are doing very well in terms of profit margin and should be looked at further to identify the strategies that are working best for them. When looking at AVG, it is evident that the lower the discount, the more money the business is making. The manufacturers with the lowest AVG are Staple Magnet (16.420), Xerox 1971 (42.105), and Staples in misc. colors (25.908). These manufacturers are doing very well in terms of discount and should be looked at further to identify the strategies that are working best for them. It is also important to look at the SUM (sales) metric to get an idea of the overall sales being made by each manufacturer. The manufacturers with the highest SUM are Samsung (46661.868), Apple (19490.290), and Microsoft (4580.396). It may be helpful to see what strategies and products these companies are utilizing to achieve such high sales numbers. Once the metrics have been examined, it is time to draw conclusions and figure out what can be done to improve the business. One way to do this would be to look at the strategies employed by the manufacturers who have the highest AGG, AVG, and SUM and see what can be applied to the business in order to increase profits. Additionally, it may be helpful to identify any weaknesses among the manufacturers and see what can be done to address those weaknesses. By looking at the data set, it is possible to identify areas that need improvement, as well as areas where the business is doing well. This can help to create a plan of action in order to ensure that the business is successful and profitable.",

let healthRes = {
key:"Health Indicators",
val:`From the data set, it appears that the countries with the lowest average GDP per capita, health expenditure as a percentage of GDP, and life expectancy are located in Africa and Asia.These countries could benefit from quick win strategies focused on improving their health care systems and providing access to better education and jobs.It is also evident that a number of countries in Europe and The Americas have higher average GDP per capita and life expectancy, but they are spending less of their GDP on health care than the countries in Africa and Asia.This could suggest that the countries in Europe and The Americas should strive to increase their investment in health care in order to further improve their health care systems and life expectancy.

Some quick win strategies that could be employed to improve health care systems in these countries include: 1.Improving access to quality healthcare facilities and services by providing free or low-cost health care to those in need. 2.Improving education and job opportunities, especially in rural and disadvantaged areas, to help reduce poverty and improve access to healthcare.

3.Investing in public health infrastructure such as clean water, improved sanitation, and nutrition programs to reduce the risk of disease. 4.Establishing public-private partnerships to help ensure adequate funding for health care and access to quality health care services.

5.Increasing investment in research and development of advanced medical techniques, technologies, and pharmaceuticals that can improve care and outcomes. 6.Training and incentivizing health care professionals to provide high-quality care, including in rural or disadvantaged areas.

7.Increasing access to mental health services, as mental health is a vital component of overall health and well-being. 8.Supporting community-based initiatives and programs to foster a culture of preventive health and promote healthy lifestyles..`
