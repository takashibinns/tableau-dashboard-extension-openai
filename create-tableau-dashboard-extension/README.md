# Tableau Dashboard Extension integratino with OpenAI's ChatGPT 

## Todo
* DashboardExtension: leverage the moderation endpoint, to ensure no "bad" content
* Config: Default prompt textbox
* Config: [bug] user must select a sheet from the dropdown (instead of just accepting the default selection)
* Info Button: doesn't do anything
* General: Do we need to reference OpenAI in a specific way? usage for their license?
